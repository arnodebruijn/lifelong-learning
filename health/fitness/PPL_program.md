Push Pull Legs Program
======================

Nomenclature
------------
* 3x10        three sets of ten repetitions
* 2x5, 1x5+   this reads as, two sets of 5, one set of at least 5, but as many as possible (more to come on this later)
* SS          superset (two exercises performed back to back with no rest in between. SUPASET)
* BB          barbell
* DB          dumbbell
* LP          linear progression means you need to add weight workout to workout, every workout.
* AMRAP       as many sets as possible while maintaining good form

PPL
---
PPL is just the initialiasm of push, pull, legs or pull, push, legs (it really doesn't matter which). This will (typically) have you doing 3 workouts, 2 times per week.

* Push - this can just be thought of as moving things away from your body (think of a bench press)
* Pull - this can be thought of as moving things towards your body (think of a row)
* Legs

You will always start the day with a heavy barbell exercise, and this is what you need to progress linearly (add weight every session). Then afterwards you will follow up with higher repetition exercises, that are more 'bodybuilding' based.

Program
-------
6 days a week PPLPPLR (where R denotes a rest day) either in Pull, Push, Legs or Push, Pull, Legs order.

Weight added per session:
* 2.5kg for upper body lifts (bench press, row, overhead press)
* 2.5kg for squats
* 5kg for deadlifts
Progression of accessories should be done as so: when you can hit 3 sets of 12 with good form, add weight. As long as you're in the 8-12 range for your sets then you're good. If not, lower the weight.

### Pull

1. Deadlifts 1x5+/Barbell rows 4x5, 1x5+ (alternate, so if you did deadlifts on Monday, you would do rows on Thursday, and so on)

Warmups
-------

Just practising the movement as a warmup. For example start with an empty bar and add weight like so:

1. Empty bar x 10
2. 95lbs x10
3. 135lbs x5
4. 185lbs x3
5. 200lbs 4x5, 1x5+

Rest
----

Don't worry too much about rest times, and worry more about just getting all your sets and reps in.

* 3-5 minutes between your first exercise of the day
* 1-3 minutes between all your other exercises

Failure
-------

If you fail a session 3 times in a row (for example, if you fail to hit 3x5 on squats at 100kg 3 times in a row), you need to lower the weight.

Deloading
---------

Deloading is taking weight off the bar. Take 10% off your working weights (so a 100kg squat would go back down to 90kg), and work back up. This should give you a good chance to push things on the AMRAP final sets. If you got 2x5 and 1x6 at 90kg the first time round, you can bet your ass that you'll get more than 6 on your last set the second time round. And by the time you work your way back up, if you can hit 97.5kg for 2x5, 1x8, 100kg for 3x5 will be trivial.
