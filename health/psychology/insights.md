========

* Attaining a goal is not what motivates you, it's the observation that your efforts move you towards that goal. For instance:
  - After receiving my Bachelors degree I felt nothing, only thing I could think about was doing a Master or work.
  - After I sold my first company I maybe felt happy for a week or so because I finally could relax. But afterwards I could only think about finding the next project.
* We spend so much time learning facts and skills, but we never learn to use our own mind.
* Valued responsibility is what gives life meaning. Not bearing a load will derail my life.
