Writing
=======

* You should avoid the passive tense. With an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing somewith. With a passive verb something is done to the subject of the sentence.
* Adverbs are for timid writers.
* The best form of dialogue attribution is "said", as in "he said, she said, Bill said".
* Basic paragraph  form is a topic sentece followed by support and description.
* Never tell a thing if you can show it.
